### What I learned
Hey everyone! I just completed the Four Card Feature Section challenge and what I think gives me the most difficulty is getting the exact widths and sizes of elements. I want the design to be fluid but sometimes I feel like I need to use exact values for widths to make the design look good. Do you guys have this issue as well?
